# BSc-Project
This project investigated the pros, cons, and technological feasibility of the two known
methods of generating artificial gravity (a linearly accelerating or rotating spacecraft) during
space travel. We determined that a linearly accelerating spacecraft was a pretty accurate representation
of gravity on Earth, but unfeasible with current energy production methods. On the other hand, we found rotational gravity
was far easier to implement but the representation of gravity on Earth is less accurate. One of the main reasons for this 
is the Coriolis force.

The Coriolis force is an inertial force experienced by an object in a rotating frame. This is observed on Earth
as the planet rotates however it's effect is minimal as the angular velocity of the Earth is small (~7 × 10⁻⁴ rpm).
However, when when looking at a spaceship rotating at say 6 rpm, the effects are much stronger.

In the first plot and animation you can see the effect of this force on a ball thrown in the air. When thrown vertically upwards
it proceeds to curve away from the person. This occurs on Earth with projectiles at very large distances, but nowhere near this extent.

In the second plot and animation you can see the effect on a Foacault pendulum. On the Earth's poles this pendulum makes a full 360
degree rotation after 24 hours. However, at 6 rpm on the spacecraft it makes this same rotation in seconds!
